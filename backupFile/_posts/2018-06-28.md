### Join 2 Tables and get the latest record

I have 2 tables table1 contains the columns of id, status,created_by,created_date,name and table2 is a log table which contains id, updated_by,updated_date. Table2 contains multiple records of same id. I'm trying to get the resultant query which support to get the selected columns from both tables by join operation. but when I tried i'm getting the duplicate records associated with that id. I want only one latest record for that id. My query...


```
SELECT t.created_by,
       t.created_date,
       tl.updated_by,
       tl.updated_date
FROM   test_name t
      INNER JOIN (SELECT tl.*,
            Row_number()
              OVER (
                partition BY id
                ORDER BY updated_date DESC ) AS seqnum
             FROM   test_log tl) tl
         ON t.id = tl.id
            AND seqnum = 1
WHERE  state = 'active';
```
